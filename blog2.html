                <h1><b>An unfolded love story</b></h1>
                <p>Love is like a heartbeat, many ups and downs.
                     Sometimes love gives us the best feeling in this world, the feeling of getting cared, respected, desired, prioritized while the other time, it drives us to the room of fear, 
                     a fear of getting alone, fear of getting hurt, feeling of being left. <br> <br>

                    Here goes a story of a boy and a girl whose love replicates the real essence of love; stressful but heals with time. The boy good looking with a charming personality and a silent nature gets a message on his 15th birthday from a 14 years old playful, extrovert and humorous girl. The boy takes it in a normal way and replies; “Thank you” for his birthday wish.
                    Unaware with the feeling that the girl liked him, he messaged her; “hi”. 
                    The message just got the girl a little stroke as the guy never approached anyone before. 
                    From that very day, her life changed. Feelings grew, emotions built, priorities changed in both of them.
                     Every night till 12, they used to send texts to know each other deeper and better.
                    Finally, the boy realized that he had feelings for that girl, a pure and real one. 
                    After several practices in front of the mirror, he expressed his feelings to her. 
                    But beyond expectations, she denied. 
                    She thought it wasn’t love but just attraction which will last for a short period of time. 
                    Who knew that deep inside her heart, she loved him, loved him like everything but as her family
                     was little confined to their conservative thoughts, she stopped herself not to hurt her parents. <br> <br>
                    
                    
                    Days passed, the boy loved her so much and had a hope in his heart that one day she will love him back exactly the
                     way he does. He never missed a chance to make her feel special and wanted. The girl also shared her feelings but
                      without the title of love. They both were happy being accompanied with each other where feelings were respected
                       without any judgment. <br><br>
                    
                    A year passed. The boy turned 16 and they decided to meet on his birthday. As they were used to with texting,
                     it was completely different to talk with each other face to face. The girl turned red and the boy was shy. 
                     They both got some present for each other which built their relationship stronger. 
                     With time, they again met in a restaurant holding their hands they sat for 5 hours getting so closed to each other. 
                     The guy was totally onto her and wanted her to be his. <br> <br>
                    
                    The girl turned 15. The boy waited the clock to reach to 12 so he could wish her first. After a long wait, 
                    it was 12 on the clock. He sent her long message he had already typed which was to be sent to her in the exact time.
                     The girl read it next day and was very happy as well as hurt because it was the last time she was texting him back. <br><br>
                    
                    She had already held her feelings for so long because just a week ago her mom saw his text where in bold was 
                    written ‘I LOVE YOU’. Her mom couldn’t see her daughter having a relationship with a guy as according to her, 
                    she was too small to handle this and skeptical whether she was in wrong hands. It was pretty normal for a mother 
                    to be concerned towards her daughter so she said her to leave him. With tears in her eyes, with a heavy heart, 
                    she messaged him a goodbye which was the most difficult bye ever; not even good. <br> <br>
                    
                    He broke, broke into pieces. He did everything to stop her and not let her go but she had a mindset to 
                    never look back because family was prior to her. Even though she loved him so much, when she had to 
                    choose she chose her family. The boy was shattered because in a go, his life changed. 
                    The thing happened with him which he never thought of. Besides, same thing was happening with the girl. 
                    Harder she tried to hold, deeper the cut became. With every message which the boy sent pleading her not to leave, 
                    she couldn’t control herself so decided to go far away from him. Out of contact with every person related to him because 
                    she knew that her existence will only worsen his wound and nothing more. So from that day, they diverged, 
                    diverged into path that never had a meeting line. <br> <br>
                    
                    With every month, day, hour, minute and second passing by, the boy missed her like crazy. And slowly with the time
                     the girl lessened his remembrance. This thing was so traumatizing for him. But actually, he learned many things in 
                     the mean while. When sunken into the state of depression after getting emotionally hurt, losing the first and last 
                     love of his life, he became strong enough to cope with this cruel world. When nobody was there, he had to stand for himself.  
                     After getting indulged into different activities made him feel that life doesn’t end here.  He understood that what 
                     is written in fate will find its way to happen and if it is written for her to come back, she will come again.  
                     He got that behind every action there is a background story and knew that her love had the circumstances where the 
                     only option she had was to leave him. So his wound began to heal, he started feeling better around. Nevertheless,
                      as love is such a strong feeling, he never stopped loving her. <br> <br>
                    
                    The guy turned 17 years old. He had moved on in his life. Despite this, when somewhere he found her name twin, 
                    all those memories used to get recalled in slides. Somewhere in his heart, he had the feeling that his love will 
                    text him and wish him on his birthday. On the other side, even the girl loved him so much that she wanted to go 
                    back in his life and relive all those beautiful days. She could no longer be harsh on herself. She remembered that 
                    it was his birthday and had been eagerly waiting to wish him. But she was haunted with the fear that maybe he had 
                    moved on and found his better half. Still she couldn’t resist and texted him. Every second after the message was 
                    sent her heart bit faster and faster and finally the guy read it. The guy was entirely happy moreover surprised 
                    when he received the text and got some hint about how she wanted to return back to him. Her explanation again grew 
                    those buried feelings and he again wanted to have the sparkle of her existence in his life. <br> <br>
                    
                    She returned with deeper love, greater passion and desire to be with him. They met and lived the life they always dream t for. <br> <br>
                    
                    Love is the best feeling in this world, so strong that it can help to conquer the whole wide world. So have patience, right thing will happen at the right time.</p>
